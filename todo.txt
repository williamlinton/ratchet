Consider:
- Standardized links?
- Move scan() directory checking to current directory?
    (so it could handle root output dir also?)

Eventually:
- Change directories from hardcoded to cmd-line args
- Find out: Can we reliably use string NULL terminators to detect the end of a string?
    - Do we want to handle a case where parsed file contents would not have one?

Important:
- Add Readme.md
- C99
- fclose() everywhere necessary


Next time:
Note: Not actually copying template file contents...
- Parse layout contents
- Dump template contents into layout and write to output file
- Change extension to HTML for template newPath
