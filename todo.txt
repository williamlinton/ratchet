Consider:
- Standardized links?
- Move scan() directory checking to current directory?
    (so it could handle root output dir also?)

Eventually:
- Change directories from hardcoded to cmd-line args
- Find out: Can we reliably use string NULL terminators to detect the end of a string?
    - Do we want to handle a case where parsed file contents would not have one?
- Use macro instead of #if LOGGING
    - log("a", asdf)
- Pull out utility functions into util.c
- Separate platform specific code from logic code
    - Move platform-specific calls to function pointers

Important:
- Add Readme.md
- C99
- fclose() everywhere necessary


Next time:
- make findFirstDirective() work (include unit tests)
- Parse layout contents
- Dump template contents into layout and write to output file
- Change extension to HTML for template newPath
